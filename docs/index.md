# Read The Docs Theme for Jekyll and GitHub Pages

This is a port of the
Some inline Latex: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

ABC = $$x^2$$
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
$$\frac{\partial u_{2:N}}{\partial t} = D_{s,i}(T)Au_{2:N}  + Bj_i(t)$$
$$\frac{\partial z_{2:N}}{\partial t} = D_{s,i}(T)V^{-1}\Lambda Vz_{2:N}  + \tilde{B}j_i(t)$$
$$\frac{\partial u_{2:N}}{\partial t} = D_{s,i}(T)V^{-1}\Lambda Vu_{2:N}  + VBj_i(t)$$
$$    \frac{\partial z_{2:N}}{\partial t} = D_{s,i}(T) \tilde{A}_iz_{2:N}  + \tilde{B}_ij_i(t) \\
    c_i = \begin{bmatrix} \tilde{C}_iz_{i,2:N} + \frac{\tilde{D}_ij_i(t)}{D_{s,i(T)}} \\ \tilde{C}_{i,c} \left( \tilde{C}_{i}z_{i,2:N} +  \frac{\tilde{D}_ij_i(t)}{D_{s,i(T)}} \right) + \frac{j_i(t)D_{s,i}(T)}{\tilde{D}_i} \end{bmatrix}$$

[Read The Docs](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io) theme to
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so that it can be used with GitHub Pages.

You are previewing the theme right now, as you navigate
[this documentation](https://carlosperate.github.io/jekyll-theme-rtd):

The original [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org)
[theme]((https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io)) was created for the
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation generator, and so it is
designed specifically for docs.

Combined with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) it's a great and easy
way to document your projects!
